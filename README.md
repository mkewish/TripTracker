# TripTracker

This IOS application allow users to log trips using Xcode's CoreData framework and a SQLite database. Trip destination, start date, end date, and image (optional) can be added, saved, and deleted.

Trip data is stored via a SQLite database and can be retrieved after the application has been stopped. Logged trips are organized in a table/list and can be rearranged using the edit button.

Note: Must have Xcode installed
